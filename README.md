tutorial-GCA-R
==============

This tutorial uses simulated data to compare mixed-effects growth curve analyses (GCAs) to
traditional ANOVA and natural polynomial mixed-effects modelling approaches.

Everything I know about GCA, I learned from Dan Mirman (http://www.danmirman.org/gca)
and by playing around in R. Here's a good Mirman paper on the topic:

   Mirman, D., Dixon, J., & Magnuson, J. S. (2008). Statistical and computational models of the  
      visual world paradigm: Growth curves and individual differences. Journal of Memory and
      Language, 59, 474â€“494.

Requires: install.packages('lmer','ggplot2','plyr','ez')
